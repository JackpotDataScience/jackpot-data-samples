Kevin Nery | 508-990-9800 | www.CoastalMandA.com | k.nery@nerycorp.com","As a business attorney, I have worked many times over the years with Kevin Nery and his team. I have always found them to be a top-notch brokerage firm. They understand that buying or selling a business is a complicated process - one that requires the utmost integrity, careful planning, attention to detail and thoughtful communication with all parties. They do their homework; they are thorough, professional and our clients have always been full of praise for Kevin and his team. I recommend them with full confidence. HORRIBLE experience. Kevin Nery is willing to lie to sell you a business and steal your money. Absolutely Despicable. Do not trust him to sell your business and do not trust buying a business from him. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. ZERO STARS. Dear Anonymous n/a, We take this matter very seriously. Unfortunately, without verification of your identity or of the specific situation, we lack the information needed to respond appropriately and work to rectify the issue. Please contact us at 508-990-9800 or at nery.corp@nerycorp.com to discuss further. For 20 years the confidentiality of our clients has been paramount to us, so we cannot discuss details of any transaction in a public forum.",(Purposfully left blank. Too large for this file)
