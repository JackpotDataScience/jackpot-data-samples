## Commentary on this Data:

Businesses do not always disclose full financial info in their listing page. As a result, we infer the key elements to a order-of-magnitude estimate:

* Less than $100K

* $100K - $1M

* $1M - $10M

* $10M - $100M

* $100M - $1B

* $1B +

This allows our clients to always have search fields without null values. They can filter to the ‘ball park’ they are looking for, and then use the other criteria to find the more specific businesses of interest.
