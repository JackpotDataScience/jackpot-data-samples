## Commentary on this Data:

You'll note that we have a 'company name' field, an 'investor name' field, and 'company/investor' listed for several of the fields. This is because some (most) investors are actual companies (e.g. Private Equity firms). We do have, however, individual level data for individual angel investors, as well as individual data for persons who work within larger firms. So we feel this is the most simple means to convey the data in one table. That said, we are happy to adjust this data however best suits your needs. 

## Delivery of this Data:

This is medium sized data, meaning there are a several ways we can deliver it, to include:

* **Encrypted Email (least preferred)** – If you don’t have a database to which we can push this data, we can always email it. We should caution, however, that though we could split this data into .csv files and send it through an encrypted email, it could be slow to open and navigate (especially in excel). 

* **API to your Database** – If you have a database in place already (Postgres, BigQuery, etc.), we can send the data direct to your database. If you are interested in this data-as-a-service, we think this is the best method.

* **We can set you up with a Database** – If you don’t have a database, no problem. We can set you up with one and push the data directly to it. 

* **API to your CRM** – Just as we can push this directly to your database, we can send this data directly to your CRM system. If that is a method you prefer, we should work together to pick the specific fields you want sent, because some of the fields have a large volume of data (e.g. website text.)

* **We can Build you a Platform** - Building custom platforms on free & open sourced software is kind of our thing. If you want to keep this data outside of your database, but still want the ability to search, visualize, and export it at the touch of a button, we can set that up for you. We’ll build you a custom platform that is password protected and restricted to your IP address.
